### About me: 
I decided to switch from chemistry research path to web development since I want to do something more practical. Coming from scientific background, I'm confident I will be able to grasp the key principles of frontend development and create numerous interesting and valuable projects. I know the fundamentals of programming and did several small projects in C and Javascript. Now I want to build big full-stack projects.
