### About me: 
I decided to switch from chemistry research path to web development since I want to do something more practical. Coming from scientific background, I'm confident I will be able to grasp the key principles of frontend development and create numerous interesting and valuable projects. I know the fundamentals of programming and did several small projects in C and Javascript. Now I want to build big full-stack projects.
### Skills:
* C, C++, Python, Java fundamentals
* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express framework basics
* Git fundamentals
* SQL Basics
### Code Example:
```
// count the digit d in the squares of numbers up to n
function nbDig(n, d) {
  let stringOfSquares = '';
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    stringOfSquares += i**2;
  }
  for (let k = 0; k < stringOfSquares.length; k++) {
    if (stringOfSquares[k] == d) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```
